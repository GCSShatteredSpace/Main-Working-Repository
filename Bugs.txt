Game enters infinite loop (turn never ends) when players press space for too many times.
Grenade does not generate damage at end of turn.
#Fixed:Collision with turrets still creates discrepency between clients.
Mines can only be fired once in the game. (easy fix)
At some angles the player can shoot in between barriers.
If you change weapon when plannning your move the attack remains
Sometimes the players attack is out of sync. (Shots hit when they are not supposed to etc.)
